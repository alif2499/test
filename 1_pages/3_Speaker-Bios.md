**Mark Edwards**, Senior Science Advisor, Office of the Chief Scientist, EPA and Adjunct Professor, University of Alberta

**Title:** Workshop introduction: Setting the stage

**Bio:** Mark has been working with Applied Conservation Ecology Lab (ACELab) as a Co-Principal Investigator on various projects including the Ronald Lake Bison Project and the Suncor Black Bear Project, among others.

Mark has been conducting field-based studies on mammals and their habitats for over 25 years. His focus on large mammals started with his PhD on Arctic grizzly bears in the Mackenzie Delta region of the Northwest Territories. His current work includes projects in Alberta and Atlantic Canada. His research is primarily focused on how animals use landscapes and how natural and human factors influence their behaviour, movements, and distribution across the landscape. His research is applied in nature with a focus on filling knowledge gaps for species that are of interest to many local groups. Currently, he is particularly interested in the influence predators such as wolves and black bears have on the Ronald Lake wood bison and on their fidelity to a large meadow complex in the northwest part of the herd’s range, and on how black bears use and co-exist with humans on industrial landscapes.

**Kayla Davis**, Quantitative Ecologist and Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Saskatchewan

**Title:** Addressing sources of error in aerial survey data: what are common pitfalls and solutions?

**Bio:** Kayla’s research is focused on developing an integrated metapopulation model to understand population dynamics and movement ecology of midcontinent populations of snow geese. She received her PhD from Michigan State University in spring 2024 where she studied avian survey methods and developed integrated models for bird species of conservation concern. Her work demonstrates how the continued assessment and improvement of data collection techniques and integrated modeling approaches can provide conservation scientists with accurate and precise estimates of population and community dynamics that can be used to inform biodiversity monitoring and conservation initiatives for birds and other taxa.

**Title:** Remote cameras sample mountain ungulate population demography as compared to aerial surveys in an Indigenous-led community-based monitoring program

**Bio:** Sydney is a Registered Professional Forester (RPF) in British Columbia (BC), with a background in wildlife ecology and habitat management through the forestry sector in both BC and Alberta. She recently graduated with a Master of Science (MSc) where her work focused on Indigenous-led community-based monitoring of Dall’s sheep and grizzly bears in the Gwich’in Settlement Area of the Northwest Territories. Her thesis explores the use of remote wildlife cameras to obtain population demography of Dall’s sheep as compared to aerial surveys, with special interest paid to community and youth engagement throughout. Concurrent to her MSc, Sydney also co-authored BC’s Thinhorn Sheep Stewardship Framework as part of the Indigenous Perspectives working group. She currently works for BC Timber Sales in the Ministry of Forests as a Planning Officer, where she is responsible for strategic planning and forest stewardship across four natural resource districts on BC’s south coast and Haida Gwaii.

**Randy Larsen**, Professor of Wildlife Ecology in the Department of Plant and Wildlife Sciences, Brigham Young University

**Title:** How telemetry can meet the multiple needs of wildlife agencies

**Bio:** Randy received a PhD from Utah State University in 2008 and was hired shortly thereafter at BYU. For the last decade, he has worked collaboratively with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources and non-profit organizations to monitor mule deer and other ungulates across Utah with GPS collars. This monitoring effort has involved capture and marking of more than 10,000 ungulates in Utah leading to a large and robust data set used to inform conservation and management efforts. These data have increased our understanding of ungulate ecology—primarily mule deer—leading to improved management of this species. He will share findings and insights learned over the last decade from this large conservation effort.
